# Horiseon Refactoring

## Description
This projects goal was to take the Horiseon webpage and alter it to allow for greater accessibility and greater search engine optimization.
This solved the inability of the visually impared to comprehend the images on page due to lack of alternate descriptions for a screen reader.
This project taught me how to utilize proper semantics and common methods for search engine optimization.

## Installation

There are no steps to instal this project apart from opening the page.

## Usage

When inspected with chrome elements, all sections of the webpage have proper semantics.
All .png and .jpeg images have an alternate description to allow the use of a screen reader.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
